Support for Oracle is currently considered experimental and a few features might not work correctly.
One known case of such a feature is OFFSET.
However, the implementation passes all active test cases, and performs well in a real-world use case.

This has been tested with Oracle 11g and the 12.1.0.2 JDBC Thin driver (ojdbc7.jar) available from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/default-2280470.html
Do not use the 12.1.0.1 driver, it is buggy and makes the entire thing explode.

Since the driver cannot be publicly distributed, you have to download it manually and place
it as an unmanaged dependency (e.g., in the lib/ folder).

Issues and pull requests should be directed to https://github.com/clangguth/sorm, from where
changes would hopefully make their way up to the official upstream repository.


Known limitations:
- String values are only supported up to a length of 4000 bytes (depending on your character set,
  that will be something between 1000 and 4000 characters). This is due to the CLOB type not being
  available in WHERE clauses, so I had to resort to VARCHAR2, which has this limit.
